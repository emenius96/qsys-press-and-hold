## Overview
### Description:
This is my revision for Q-SYS Press and Hold component with a scalable control count (2 to 64) and boolean output logic for short and long press.
Can be used for generating single button for saving and recalling presets (much like in our Level 2 course) but also provide that Boolean feedback for driving other controls in your design. e.g., displaying a "preset saved" layer on your UCI.

## Instructions

### How to Contribute:
To view the underlying code, open 'press-and-hold-v1.0.qplug' in your code editor, you can find the main Lua script at towards the end starting from the 'if Controls'.
